# the pitch

## exercise

I want you to think about how you would replicate the exact same development environment across a team of developers.
Don't say anyhting at first - think it over. 

How would you do it for a team of 5 or less? 
How would you do it for more than 5? More than 10?

What does your Cadillac version of this implementation look like?
What does the cheaper version look like?
Could you do it for free?

## finding that happy middle ground

1. More reproducibile environments

As the cdo I want:
1. better interoperability between the teams and roles
1. better code security

As IT I want:
1. Tools that fit within the gaurdrails already setup
1. reduce reliance on shadow IT
